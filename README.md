# Store Sales

Store data includes originally at start of project (within the first 5 commits): 

    - sales representatives and regional areas
    
    - orders placed and customers delivered to

    - orders returned (boolean and ID)

Goals: 
    - Determine Sales Growth KPI

        > Sales Growth = (Current period sales - Sales during past period) / Sales during past period x 100

            > Requires breaking down current sales data into periods

    - Hone in on Returns 

        > Segment, State, Category, and Product Name

            > Questions to ask in the effort of improvement:
            1) What kind of consumer is most often returning?
            2) Is there a geographical area items are returned from most?
            3) Is there a particular category that is most frequently returned?
            4) Does one product get returned more than others?  

    - Considering the sales growth, would it make sense to split the West into two separate regions of the West and Northwest?
